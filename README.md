Why I do this:
I bought a chinese made ebike in Israel and all these israeli chinese
ebikes are quite the same, the just have different stickers and 
only smonetimes different frames.
My bike is from kalofan.co.il and I bought it used, its a 26 inch city bike.

I dont want the chinese bicycle companies derive from my work, and get rich!
They should do it right in the first place so I dont have to feel bad when
biking with their controllers and simple block commutation and some bad 
usability they should pay me for my development by giving me some free bikes
 or some money for my engineering.

PRIVATE USE IS FREE
If you are private, and feel that you need to improve your bike, go ahead 
and build but dont blame me if the police catches you or you have an
accident. You use this on your own risk.
YOU ARE THE MANUFACTURER, AS THIS IS ONLY CODE WHICH YOU INTEGRATE INTO
